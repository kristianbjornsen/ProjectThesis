\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lens distortion correction. Try using the method involving checkerboard pattern calibration to extract the camera parameters for correction. This will improve the consistency of the measurements across the board.
\item Tune edge detection algorithm in terms of height. This is very beneficial if we want a system that can take images at different heights of the maze. Will improve accuracy.
\item GSD with an angle $\neq 90 \deg$. At the moment the system is assumed to be taking an image normal to the ground- and wall plane. With a GSD angle $\neq 90 \deg$ there will be more work to transform the image from a 3-D image to the 2-D xy-plane.
\item Specify the components of the UAV to be used in this implementation:
\begin{itemize}
\item UAV frame (size)
\item Communication module
\item Autopilot
\item Sensor-package including image sensor
\item Processing power
\item Image processing on-board or on server?
\end{itemize}

\item More research on the Hough transform, and how we can assure that we detect the whole wall segment.

\end{itemize}
