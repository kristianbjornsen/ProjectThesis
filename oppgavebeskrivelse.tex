\section*{Problem description}
We are attempting to map a maze by using an image sensor mounted on a UAV. Some mapping implementations already exist by using Lego robots. The goal of this project report is to introduce a different method for maze mapping than that of the Lego robots. The method we want to examine is the use of an image sensor mounted on a UAV flying above the maze. We want to determine how one can go about developing a system that will identify the characteristics of a maze. The image processing part of this over-arching goal is the problem description of this report.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Can the accuracy of the characterization of the maze be improved using an image sensor?
\item Determine if there are any built in benefits of using an image sensor and image processing to map the maze?
\item Determine what algorithms are best suited for identification of walls in the maze.
\item Determine what measurements are needed in order to map the maze.
\end{itemize}
