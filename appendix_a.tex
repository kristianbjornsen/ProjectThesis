\subsection{Pictures}
This is a folder containing the pictures used and tested by the algorithm for the maze mapping. 
\subsection{Figures}
This folder contains the figures used in the different section of the report not including the discussion section.
\subsection{Software}
This includes the following software:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{AnalyserBilde.m}. This is the complete implementation of the edge detection algorithm together with the mapping implementation. 
\item \texttt{choicetest.m}. This is the implementation of the edge detection choice test presented in section \ref{choice}. 
\end{itemize}
It also includes two images which are the inputs for the implementation.
\subsection{Results}
This folder includes the figures from the discussion section, as well as the figures outputted by the implementation of the algorithm.

\subsection{GSD Calculator}
This folder includes a GSD calculator I used in Microsoft Excel created by \url{www.pix4d.com}

\subsection{Previous Reports}
The previous reports used in this report is included.
